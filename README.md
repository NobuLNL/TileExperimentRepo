# Exploring Bike Lockers in King County Transit Stations

## Introduction
This map is an exploration of all of the transit stations in King County with bike lockers. I wanted to see despite our local governance wanting us all to move towards more sustainable transportation, how much our current infrastructure can support that ideal. This [map](https://nobulnl.github.io/TileExperimentRepo/) shows all of the transit stations in King County that have bike lockers. Bike lockers are simply containers in which riders of local transit can store their bikes securely to prevent theft and allow them to take a bus or train unencumbered by their bikes.
